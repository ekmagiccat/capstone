# Capstone Project: ☕ It's Coffee Time! ☕

### By Eva Kemp &#x1F483;

## Description

This is my final capstone project for Epicodus. It is an instructional guide and game that teaches a user how to make pour-over coffee. The user can then practice adding the correct water ratio to an interactive UI representation of a pour-over coffee set-up.

## Technologies Used

- Git
- Markdown
- React
- TypeScript
- JSX
- HTML
- CSS
- Node
- Bootstrap
- Material UI
- Framer-Motion
- React Spring

## **Setup/Installation Requirements**

Initial Setup

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/ekmagiccat/capstone
  ```
- Open VS Code (or your IDE of choice).
- Open the top level directory you just cloned.

## Download Necessary Packages

In the project directory, run:

- For Material UI:

```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

```bash
npm test
```

```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
