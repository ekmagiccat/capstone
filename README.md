# Capstone Proposal

### By Eva Kemp

## Description

This is a planning outline for my final capstone project at Epicodus.
The application will be an instructional guide that teaches a user how to make pour-over coffee. The user can then practice themselves with an interactive UI representation of a pour-over coffee set-up.

## Technologies Used

- Git
- Markdown
- React
- Bootstrap
- Material UI
- Framer-Motion
- Spring

## **Setup/Installation Requirements**

Initial Setup

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/ekmagiccat/capstone
  ```
- Open VS Code (or your IDE of choice).
- Open the top level directory you just cloned.
